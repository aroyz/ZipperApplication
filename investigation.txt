Zippers!

Possible Zipper Properties:
Type - Coil (lightweight and flexible, teeth made from coiled nylon), Molded Plastic (stiff, plastic molded directly onto tape, usually cheap), Metal (durable, heavy), or Invisible (teeth on the backside so they're hidden).
Length - Could really be any length! They sell a lot of different zippers.
Size - Zipper sizing is measured in numbers from 1-10 and always with a # symbol in front of it. So a zipper could be #1 size or up to #10 size. Size refers to the width in mm of the teeth.
Tape Colour - The fabric that the teeth of the zipper is attached to is called the 'tape' and can be any colour you want to match with whatever it's being sewn onto
Closure Type - Closure can be either Closed Bottom or Separating. Closed bottom has a bar across the bottom of the zipper that keeps the two sides attached in one piece. Separating zippers can come apart (like the kind on a jacket).
Waterproof (Y/N) - Some zippers are waterproof so that could be an option.
Weight - Like length could be anything. Affects the type of project it's used on (lighter zippers are better for lighter garments to not weigh them down)

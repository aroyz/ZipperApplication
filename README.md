# Royal Zippers

Royal Zippers is an MVC Application using ASP.NET Core MVC. It's a website for a fictional company, Royal Zippers, which sells - you guessed it! - zippers.

## Investigation

- I researched types of zippers and browsed some sites that sell zippers to see what sort of properties they had
- The bulk of my info came from these sites:
  - https://doitbetteryourself.club/blog/understanding-zipper-types-weights-sizes-and-parts/
  - https://sewguide.com/zipper-anatomy-and-types/
  - https://www.zippershipper.com/
- Possible Zipper Properties:
  - Type: Coil (lightweight and flexible, teeth made from coiled nylon), Molded Plastic (stiff, plastic molded directly onto tape, usually cheap), Metal (durable, heavy), or Invisible (teeth on the backside so they're hidden).
  - Length: Could really be any length! They sell a lot of different zippers.
  - Size: Zipper sizing is measured in numbers from 1-10 and always with a # symbol in front of it. So a zipper could be #1 size or up to #10 size. Size refers to the width in mm of the teeth.
  - Tape Colour: The fabric that the teeth of the zipper is attached to is called the 'tape' and can be any colour you want to match with whatever it's being sewn onto
  - Closure Type: Closure can be either Closed Bottom or Separating. Closed bottom has a bar across the bottom of the zipper that keeps the two sides attached in one piece. Separating zippers can come apart (like the kind on a jacket).
  - Waterproof (Y/N): Some zippers are waterproof so that could be an option.
  - Weight: Like length could be anything. Affects the type of project it's used on (lighter zippers are better for lighter garments to not weigh them down)
  - Continuous (Y/N) - Continuous zippers don't have a finished end so they can be bought it really long strands and modified to whatever length you want.
- Settled on using just Type, Length, Size, Tape Colour and Closure Type too keep it manageable
- Also researched who invented zippers for the About Page! Apparently in 1893 an inventor and businessman Whitcomb Judson (who also invented a pneumatic street railway!) patented and popularized a "Clasp Locker" and founded the Universal Fastner Company to sell it. Though technically, since it wasn't designed for use on clothing, it wasn't what we now know as a zipper. Apparently the history of zippers is complicated!

## Coding

I followed the MvcMovie tutorial for the basics and made changed where I needed to. I overhauled the layout of the Zipper Index page, added an About Page, and made many other small changes throughout to make the project unique. Detailed overview of my entire process is entailed in the README.txt file in the ZipperApplication directory.
